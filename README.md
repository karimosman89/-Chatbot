# Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a conversational AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user input, process the text using machine learning models, and provide relevant responses. The chatbot can be extended with domain-specific knowledge and custom responses.

## Features
- Text-based conversational bot
- Trained on a custom dataset
- NLP pipeline including tokenization, embedding, and intent classification
- Includes response generation based on intent

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karimosman/Chatbot.git
   cd Chatbot

2. Install the required packages:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The chatbot uses an intents.json file located in the **/data** directory to define the user intents, examples of user input, and corresponding responses. You can modify this file to add new intents or update responses.


## Usage

1. Train the Model:
    Train the chatbot's machine-learning model based on the dataset (intents.json).

            python src/train.py


2. Run the Chatbot:

         python src/chatbot.py

You can now interact with the chatbot. For example:


          > Hello
          Hello! How can I help you?



3. Modify the Dataset:

      Update the **intents.json** file to add new tags, patterns, or responses, and retrain the model using the **train.py** script.


## Testing

Unit tests are provided to ensure the chatbot logic and utilities function as expected. Run the tests using:


            python -m unittest discover -s tests



## Model Details

The chatbot uses a machine-learning pipeline with the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stemming, and word embedding (using TF-IDF or word vectors).
2. **Intent Classification:** A machine learning classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine or Neural Network) to predict user intent based on input.
3. **Response Generation:** Based on the predicted intent, an appropriate response is selected from the dataset.

   
## Requirements

The required dependencies can be installed via **pip**:

1.**nltk:** Natural Language Toolkit.
2.**scikit-learn:** Machine Learning Library.
3.**numpy:** Numerical computations.
4.**pandas:** Data manipulation.
5.**tensorflow or keras:** (Optional) Neural network-based models.


Install them by running:


      pip install -r requirements.txt

     
## Future Enhancements

1.**Integration with APIs:** Expand the chatbot to fetch live data (e.g., weather, stock prices).
2.**Context Management:** Add context handling to allow the bot to remember the conversation state.
3.**GUI Interface:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the chatbot.
